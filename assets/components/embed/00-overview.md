<div class="jumpnav"></div>

The role of the embed component is solely to make third-party embeds, like YouTube videos, responsive. This minimal scope allows embeds to be used in many different contexts. However, because they are typically <em>self-contained units of content</em>, the best way to lay out embeds on a page is with the <a href="/components/figure">figure component</a>. This page demonstrates this common use case.

<p class="notice notice--info">With figures comes the ability to add captions. While providing a caption is definitely recommended, note that it is better not to have one than for it to simply duplicate the title of the embedded content (i.e. the <code>title</code> of the HTML page loaded within the iframe).</p>
