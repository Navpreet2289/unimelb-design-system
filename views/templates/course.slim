Each of the six determinants of health ( genetics, environment, nutrition, welfare, infectious disease and exposure to toxic agents) is explored with reference to authentic case studies. Appreciation of the multifactorial nature of health determination is then developed as students apply their understanding to cases that require integration of multiple principles in the analysis of animal health issues. Through industry based placements as well as case based syndicate work, students apply their understanding o...

It includes as appropriate, taxonomic and life cycle considerations of arthropods, nematodes, trematodes and cestodes, protozoa, fungi, bacteria and viruses; the host-parasite interaction and the pathogenesis of disease, disease transmission and epidemiology, methods of diagnosis of infectious disease as well as vaccination and treatment. This understanding is then applied to the public health and food safety context where the focus is on promotion and protection of human health; and to the herd or flock level, where the multifactorial nature of disease is reviewed, and techniques for measu...

Integrating knowledge and understanding derived from every subject in their course, students evaluate issues relating to animal health, welfare and production and conduct critical analysis of data provided to them. Successful completion of this subject will be based on participation in the requisite number of approved placements and submission of written reports.

Students will be introduced to the structural and functional organisational units of the body and to the fundamental principles of veterinary anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, general pathology and immunology. Students will gain a theoretical knowledge and practical laboratory skills that are fundamental to an appraisal of the health of domestic animals.

Integrating knowledge and understanding derived from every subject in their course, students evaluate issues relating to animal health, welfare and production and conduct critical analysis of data provided to them. Successful completion of this subject will be based on participation in the requisite number of approved placements and submission of written reports.

            h2 Fees for international graduate students
            p The course fee per year is calculated on the basis of one full-time year of study (1 EFTSL). If a course duration is less than one year, you will pay the indicative total course fee. Actual fees vary depending on the subjects you are taking. The University reviews fees annually. The indicative total course fee is based on typical subject enrolments, and includes an indexation of 5% per annum. <a href="http://futurestudents.unimelb.edu.au/admissions/fees" target="_blank">More information about tuition fees</a>.
            p If you are an international student, you may be eligible for a range of scholarships or grants.
